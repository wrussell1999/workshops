## Why should I use Java?

Java is a language that has been around for ages. Lots of university students learn it in their first year of university to under Object Oriented Programming so you might already know it! It's also used in industry for a huge variety of products!

As Android apps were originally written in Java, there's lots of guides and documentation to help guide you along too!
